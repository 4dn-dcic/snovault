Installation Instructions
=========================

Currently these are for Mac OSX using homebrew. If using linux, install dependencies with a different package manager.

Step 0: Install Xcode (from App Store) and homebrew: http://brew.sh

Step 1: Verify that homebrew is working properly::

    $ brew doctor


Step 2: Install or update dependencies::

    $ brew install libevent libmagic libxml2 libxslt openssl postgresql graphviz python3
    $ brew install freetype libjpeg libtiff littlecms webp  # Required by Pillow
    $ brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
    $ brew tap homebrew/versions
    $ brew install elasticsearch@5.6

If you need to update dependencies::

    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade
    $ rm -rf snowflakes/eggs


Step 3: Run poetry::

If you are initializing versions of poetry to use, or trying to upgrade:

    $ poetry update

Once initialized, or if you are downloading a packaged version:

    $ poetry install

    NOTE:
    If you have issues with postgres or the python interface to it (psycogpg2) you probably need to install postgresql
    via homebrew (as above)
    If you have issues with Pillow you may need to install new xcode command line tools:
    - First update Xcode from AppStore (reboot)
    $ xcode-select --install
    If you are running macOS Mojave, you may need to run the below command as well:
    $ sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /



If you wish to completely rebuild the application, or have updated dependencies:
    $ make clean

    Then goto Step 3.
