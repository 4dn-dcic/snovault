info:
	@: $(info Here are some 'make' options:)
	   $(info - Use 'make clean' to clear out (non-python) dependencies)
	   $(info - Use 'make configure' to install poetry, though 'make build' will do it automatically.)
	   $(info - Use 'make build' to build only application dependencies (or 'make macbuild' on OSX Catalina))
	   $(info - Use 'make moto-setup' if you did 'poetry install' but did not set up moto for testing.)
	   $(info - Use 'make test' to run tests with the normal options we use on travis)
	   $(info - Use 'make update' to update dependencies (and the lock file))
