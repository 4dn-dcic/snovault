Resources
===========================

**Work in progress!**

This document outlines different classes that compose a base Snovault item. Code is located in the following files:

- `resources.py <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/snovault/blob/master/src/snovault/resources.py>`_: Root, AbstractCollection, Collection, Item classes
- `typeinfo.py <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/snovault/blob/master/src/snovault/typeinfo.py>`_: AbstractTypeInfo, TypeInfo, TypesTool
- `config.py <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/snovault/blob/master/src/snovault/config.py>`_: CollectionsTool, collection and abstract_collection decorators

**TODO: outline the role of each resource class. Include a complete example**
